# Developer's Fundamentals
# I- learn efficient ways of doing things, examples of different methods and function - don't memorize everything, go by the most useful tools'
#II- Commenting your code - adding value through comments, keep it simple, easy to read, make sure they are understandable
#III- Know what data structure to use and when - takes practice and experience
#IV- What is good, clean code?  
    #Concise but not too concise, needs to be readable - 
    #Easily readable, no extra stuff - don't use obscure keywords - 
    #Predictability (each part efficiently does one thing really well) - 
    #DRY (don't repeat yourself)
#V- Test your assumptions, test code in detail, prove that ach part of the code is what you think it is
#VI- Libraries enable you to not have to start from scratch, but only use if:
    #there is broad support for the library
    #you can't just write your own library for the purpose at hand
    #read about libraries and combine different techniques to create something useful
#VII- Pick the right library - up to date, lots of community support

#Each coding language excels at some things and doesn't excel at others - they are specialized so many are needed
#For each language, learn:  Terms, Data Types, Actions, and Best Practices
#Lists
#   list slicing creates new list
#   lists are mutable, unlike strings
#   copying different from modifying a list
#
#4 Pillars of OOP
#   1- Encapsulation- use classes, attributes, methods, etc. to build an integrated structure.  Rather than separating classes an attributes, wrap them all in the same function
#   2- Abstraction - getting access to only what is necessary 
#       using built-in function
#       avoid coding from scratch 
#       abstract away variables for which the details aren't necessary to understand
#       use private variable (._name) to abstract away.  Dunder methods are example
#   3- Inheritance - new objects take on the properties of existing objects 
#       inherit classes, parent and children - avoids repeating code
#   4- Polymorphism - output different according to what object is calling it - enables customization of methods according to specific uses

#Data Types 
#   Fundamental, Custom (Classes), Specialized, None, and Complex (imaginary)

#   int - stored binary
#       
#   float - stored in two places, one binary before the . and one after
#   string - sometimes single quotes, sometimes double; concatenation only uses strings
#   escape sequences - 
#       Variables in snake case, only letters, numbers, and underscores.  Are case sensitive. Constants are variables which are not changed
#       One way of assigning variables - A,B,C = 1,2,3 =>> A1, B2, C3
#Expressions vs. Statements - expression is a piece of code producing a value, 
#   statement is like iq = 5
#Augmented Assignment Operator - i = += 2
#Escape Sequences - >  \  what comes after is string, used to deal with single vs double quotes
#   \t add table after \
#   \n add carriage return after \
#Formatted Strings - f-string - print(f'hi' + {name} + '.  You are str{age} + years old'.)
#String Indexes - [start:stop:stepover]  - 
#[0:7] from zero to seven not including seven - 
#[0:8:2] from zero to eight not including eight, stepping over 2 at a time
#[1:]from 1 until the end
#[: : 1] show all from beginning to end, stepping one by one
#[-1] only the last member of the list
#[: : -1] the whole list in reverse order
#Immutability of strings:  assigned permanently, have to make new to change
#Built-in methods - owned by something (print, len, int, str, abs, round)
#String methods:  .lower, .upper, .capitalize (beginning of words only), .count, dunder methods, 
#.find, .replace
#bool - to control flow of program; do one thing if true, another if false.  Truthy and Falsy
#Data types interact - example is when you use int or str to change the type
#List actions -  .append (to end of list), insert, extend (unpacks iterable) - these three modify the list in place
    #pop - removes last item; pop(0)- removes item at index 0; remove(4)- removes the value 4 not index; join (takes iterable)- new sentence = ' '.join(['hi', 'my', 'name', 'is', 'JOJO'] join the space with each quoted item); clear; index(value, start, stop); count('value'); sort (does not produce new array, modifies in place); copy; reverse (used with sort) or another way is: [::-1] which creates new list
#List functions- len, True, in, sorted (produces new array, new copy, like [:])
#List Unpacking- 
    #a,b,c *other, d = [1,2,,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]
    #print(a) => 1
    #print(b) => 2
    #print(c) => 3
    #print(other) => [4,5,6,7,8]
    #print(d) => 9
#None, null = absence of value, used as a starting point
#Dictionaries
    #ordered
    #can contain lists, bool, strings, etc.
    #dictionaries can hold more information, more efficient use of resources
    #dictionary keys are immutable and unique
    #.keys, .items, .values, .clear, .copy, .pop, .popitem, .update - print(user.update({'ages':55}))
#Tuples
    #immutable lists
    #accessible through indexing
    #communicates that shouldn't be changed
    #makes code more predictable, efficient, easier, faster than list to process, less flexible though
    #tuple can be a key in dicctionary
    #(2,) tuple with single item
    #x,y,z, other works with tuples, also .count, .indx, print
#Sets
    #unordered, unique objects (no duplicates)
    #each item in one and only one location in memory
    #doesn't allow duplicates to be added
    #making a set out of a list returns only the unique items
    #no indexing
    #.add, .copy, clear, and the functions in, len, list
    #also .difference (print(my_set.difference(your_set)))
    #also .discard() discard a value in a set
    #.difference_update - remove all items of another set from this set
    #.intersection - items in common
    #.isdisjoint - are the Venn diagram circles overlapping? no = disjoint
    # .union or | - unites but removes duplicates
    #.issubset - my_set is subset of your_set
    #.superset - my_set encompasses everything that is in your_set

#Conditional Logic - controlling the flow of the code, telling it to skip lines according to conditional logic
    #elif- can have multiple ones
    #indentation spacing - 4 spaces or tab, is distinction between hierarchies

#Falsy and Truthy
    #1 True 0 False

# new_list = basket.append(100)
# print(basket)
# print(new_list)

# Grok Says:  Why does append return None?
# In Python, methods that modify an object in place (like list.append, list.extend, list.remove, etc.) typically return None to indicate they mutate the object directly rather than creating a new one. This is a design choice to make it clear that the operation is in-place. Methods that return a new object (like list.copy or string methods like str.upper) return the new object instead.

# basket = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd','e']
# print('b' in basket)

# scores = [85, 92, 78, 95, 88]
# scores.sort(reverse=True)
# print(scores)  # Output: [95, 92, 88, 85, 78]

# Grok says about sort, sorted and reverse:
# Why Use a Sorted Reversed List?
# A sorted reversed list is useful when:

# You need to prioritize higher values (e.g., scores, prices, or timestamps) for tasks like ranking, filtering, or displaying data.
# The problem requires descending order, such as showing the "top N" items or processing data from most recent to oldest
# Choose sort(reverse=True) to modify the original list efficiently.
# Choose sorted(..., reverse=True) to preserve the original data or work with non-list iterables.

# List Unpacking:
# a,b,c, *other, d = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]
# print(a)
# print(b)
# print(c)
# print(other)
# print(d)

# other is in between the first three and the last element
# Grok says:  
# uses unpacking with the * operator to assign values from the list to variables. The *other part is a special feature in Python called extended unpacking, introduced in Python 3, which collects any remaining elements into a list after assigning specific elements to other variables.
# The * collects these "other" elements into a list named other.

# Capture variable-length elements:
# Simplify code
# Extracting First, Last, and Middle Elements - 
# Example: Parsing a log file where the first two fields are metadata, the last field is a timestamp, and the middle fields are data

# using sets for lookups:
# my_set = {1,2,3,4,5,6}
# print(1 in my_set)

# These use cases demonstrate setsâ€™ power in scenarios requiring uniqueness, fast lookups, or mathematical operations, making them a go-to choice for data processing, filtering, and algorithmic tasks in Python.
